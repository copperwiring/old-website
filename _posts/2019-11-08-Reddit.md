For those not familiar, [r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/) is a subreddit on the popular social media platorm [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com). This subreddit brings toether some of the best horror stories originally written by the authors who post the stories. Also, I haven't by far haven't seen any sci-fi story here. All of them make an attempt to make it a lifelike story.

One of the finest story I have ever read it titled " I Dared My Best Friend to Ruin My Life - He's Succeeding" and can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4q03fa/i_dared_my_best_friend_to_ruin_my_life_hes/). This 8 part series takes you down a chilling ride of shock and horror. So lifelike is the authors potrayal of the story that you could feel it happening at that very moment. If you haven't read it before, it is highly recommended. And yes, read all the parts in one go for the most fun!
